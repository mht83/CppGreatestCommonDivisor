# CppGreatestCommonDivisor

## Overview
This repository contains a simple C++ program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The program demonstrates the use of basic C++ syntax, including control structures, input/output operations, and variable declarations.

## How to Run
To run this program, you will need a C++ compiler like g++, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mht83/CppGreatestCommonDivisor.git
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
cd CppGreatestCommonDivisor
3. Compile the program:
g++ -o GCD main.cpp
4. Run the executable:
./GCD
## Program Description
The program prompts the user to enter two integers. It then calculates and displays the GCD of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
